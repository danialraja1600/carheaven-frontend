Car Heaven REACT Front-end

- Description
  - An SPA application called Car Heaven created with the MERN stack.
  - The app provides the user a way to view cars on sale and also upcoming events.
  - An account is needed to sell a car and to publish upcoming events.
  - This app consists of two sides, client(frontend) and server(backend).
 
  - I chose this idea because I am really fond of cars. I am a very big fan of racing. Therefore, this idea was best related to me. 
    Also, I am looking to purchase my next car in a few days so this app would be perfect for me. 
 
  - This app has restrictions to users that are not logged in. If a user is not logged in, then the user can only see the list of cars and events on sale.
    The user will not be view any of the cars or events that are being displayed individually on the details page. 
    They will not be able to create their own car to sell.
    They will not be able to create their own event.
    
    User has ability to sign up, if they do not have an account. 
    Once user logs in succesfully, they will be able to display individual cars that are on sale.
    They will be able to create their own car to sell.
    They will be able to create their own event to sell.
    These will be displayed on My Cars Page or My Events Page and also the main pages in which all users can see.
    User is able to update and delete what they have created.
    User can only update their own car or event.
